        "about":"Sometimes a power surge or short circuit can cause the breaker to trip or a fuse to blow. If your air conditioner doesnطt seem to have power, we start by checking the breaker panel or fuse panel. Flipping a breaker back into position or replacing a blown fuse should restore power to the unit. A dirty or clogged air filter can reduce airflow and affect the cooling efficiency of the AC. Regularly change or clean the filter to ensure optimal performance.If you notice ice forming on the evaporator coils or other parts of the AC, the we will turn off the unit and allow it to thaw. Ice buildup can hinder proper cooling.Ensure that the supply and return vents are free from dust, debris, or obstructions. Blocked vents can restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency.The outdoor compressor unit needs adequate airflow. Remove any vegetation, debris, or objects around it to maintain proper ventilation.Check for leaks, gaps, or disconnected ducts. Damaged ducts can lead to inefficient cooling and uneven temperature distribution.Over time, dust and dirt can accumulate on the evaporator coils. Clean them using a soft brush or a coil cleaner to improve cooling efficiency."
