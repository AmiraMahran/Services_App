        "about": "cleaning the exterior of your car steps be like: Parking Your Car in the Shade: Move your car out of direct sunlight as we need tp prevent water spots from drying on the paint. Picking the Right Soap: we don’t use the liquid soap from houses as they have ingredients that is harmful for your car. so, we get a specially formulated car washing soap from your local auto parts store.  Using the Best Cloth:we use a microfiber cloth instead of a sponge or old t-shirt. The other materials may not pick up everything we’re trying to remove from the vehicle surface. Using the Two Bucket Method: we used to fill one bucket with water and another with water mixed with car detergent. This helps prevent transferring dirt while washing. Starting the Actual Washing Process: we dip a microfiber cloth in the soapy water and scrub the surface of your car using up-and-down motions. Rinsing Soup: we give your car more than one rinse till remaining soap is removed. Drying Your Car: we use a clean microfiber cloth to dry your car thoroughly, preventing water spots. Adding Protectant: Consider applying wax or a protective sealant to enhance shine and protect the paint."

If your air conditioner doesnطt seem to have power, we start by checking the breaker panel or fuse panel. Flipping a breaker back into position or replacing a blown fuse should restore power to the unit. A dirty or clogged air filter can reduce airflow and affect the cooling efficiency of the AC. Regularly change or clean the filter to ensure optimal performance.If you notice ice forming on the evaporator coils or other parts of the AC, the we will turn off the unit and allow it to thaw. Ice buildup can hinder proper cooling.Ensure that the supply and return vents are free from dust, debris, or obstructions. Blocked vents can restrict airflow and reduce cooling efficiency.The outdoor compressor unit needs adequate airflow. Remove any vegetation, debris, or objects around it to maintain proper ventilation.Check for leaks, gaps, or disconnected ducts. Damaged ducts can lead to inefficient cooling and uneven temperature distribution.Over time, dust and dirt can accumulate on the evaporator coils. Clean them using a soft brush or a coil cleaner to improve cooling efficiency."
